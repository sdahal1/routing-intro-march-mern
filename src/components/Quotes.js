            <p>It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.
The path to success is to take massive, determined action.
The past does not equal the future.
The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships.
Quality questions create a quality life. Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.
A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken a new action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided.
People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them.
Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.</p>
